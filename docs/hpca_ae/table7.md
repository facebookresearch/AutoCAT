# Table VII: comparison of PLRU with and without PLCache

We compare the attack patterns found in Table VII and epochs need for PL cache and normal PLRU cache.


![](../../fig/table7.png)

First, go to the directory.

```
cd ${GIT_ROOT}/src/rlmeta
```

(Optional) To train a config in Table VII, use the following script:

```
$ python train_ppo_attack.py env_config=<NAME_OF_THE_CONFIG>
```

There are 2 configs in Table VII, and we have ```hpca_ae_exp_7_baseline```, ```hpca_ae_exp_7_pl``` correpondingly, replace ```<NAME_OF_THE_CONFIG>``` with these.

Use ```Ctrl+C``` to interrupt the training, which will save a checkpoint in the given path.

Since the training takes some time, we provide pretrained checkpoints in the following directory ```src/rlmeta/data/table7```. For each folder, we include the ```ppo_agent-X.pth``` which is the last checkpoint in the training processes, we also include the training logs.


Use the following to grep the interested information from ```train_ppo_attack.log```

```
$ cat train_ppo_attack.log |grep Eval | awk '{print  $4 $5 $6 $7 $8 $9 $10 $11 $12 $13 $14 $15 $16 $56 $57 $58 $59 $60 $61 $62 $63 $64 $65 $66 $67 $68 $69 $70 $71 $72} '
```

which will print out the mean/max/min of ```episode_length```, ```correct_rate``` for the each epoch.

For example,

```
$ cat hpca_ae_exp_7_baseline/exp_1/train_ppo_attack.log |grep Eval | awk '{print  $4 $5 $6 $7 $8 $9 $10 $11 $12 $13 $14 $15 $16 $56 $57 $58 $59 $60 $61 $62 $63 $64 $65 $66 $67 $68 $69 $70 $71 $72}'
```
will print out the following

```

You can see that at epoch **13** the ```correct_rate``` jump to 1.0 in this case, whose corresponding ```episode_length``` is 7.0. For baseline and PLcache, we perform three experiments each and calculate the corresponding average epoch to converge and episode_length at the end.
